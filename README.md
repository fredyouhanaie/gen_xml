# gen_xml

A behaviour module for processing an XML document.

This is the generic version of a couple of near-identical modules I
have used in other projects.

## Build and test

The [rebar3](https://rebar3.org/) tool is used for all the development
processes.

    $ rebar3 dialyzer
    $ rebar3 eunit
    $ rebar3 shell
    ...
