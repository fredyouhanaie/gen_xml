# `gen_xml` examples

## The `counts` callback module

The `genxml_counts` module is used for testing and benchmarking.

It can also be used as a template for new callback modules.

The module will return the count of the element tags found in the XML
document.

The callback module can be run manually against a file `File` with:

    $ cd genxml
    $ rebar3 shell
    > genxml_counts:start(File).
